# Problem 1

### Importing pols-month data set:

``` r
pols_df = (
  read_csv("datasets/pols-month.csv") |> 
    janitor::clean_names()
)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Importing unemployment.csv data set:

``` r
unemployment_df = (
  read_csv("datasets/unemployment.csv") |> 
    janitor::clean_names()
)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Importing snp.csv data set:

``` r
snp_df = (
  read_csv("datasets/snp.csv") |> 
    janitor::clean_names()
)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Cleaning the data in pols_df:

``` r
pols_df <- pols_df |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
    day = as.integer(day),
    president = case_when(
      prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_  # to get rid of any missing values
    )
  ) |> 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) #drops old columns
```

### Cleaning the data in snp_df:

``` r
snp_df <- snp_df |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
    day = as.integer(day),
    year = ifelse(year < 50, year + 2000, year + 1900),
  ) |> 
  select(-day) |>  # drops old column
  select(year, month, close)
```

### Cleaning the data in unemployment_df:

``` r
unemployment_df <- unemployment_df |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = jan:dec,      # pivot these columns
    names_to = "month",  # new name is "month"
    values_to = "unemployment (%)"  # new column is for the values
  )
```

### Joining the data sets:

``` r
merged_df <- left_join(
  pols_df, snp_df, 
  by = c("year", "month")) |>
  left_join(
    unemployment_df, 
    by = c("year", "month"))
```

### Description of data sets:

The pols-month.csv data set contained 822 observations of 9 variables
related to the number of national politicians who are democratic or
republican at any given time. I cleaned this data set so that the “mon”
column was split into “year”, “month”, and “day,” and replaced the month
number with the actual name of the month. The key variables were
prez_gop, an indicator of whether the president was republican on the
associated date, and prez_dem, an indicator of whether the president was
democratic on the associated date. Both columns were binary and had an
output of 1 (yes) or 0 (no). I combined these columns into a “president”
column, indicating whether the president was democratic or republican
for any given date. The years ranged from 1947 to 2015.

The snp.csv data set contained 787 observations of 2 variables related
to the S&P, which is often used as a representative measure of the stock
market performance as whole. The key variables were “date,” which was
again split into three columns, and “close,” indicating the closing
values of the S&P stock index on the given date. The years ranged from
1950 to 2015.

The unemployment.csv data set contained 68 observations of 13 variables.
The first column was “year” and every other column was a month out of
the year, representing the percentage of unemployment in that particular
month in the associated year. I made the data set “longer” so that it
can be merged with the other data sets. The years ranged from 1948 to
2015.

The resulting merged data set contains “year” and “month” as the first
two columns, since I removed the “day” column from each data set and
joined the data sets with these columns as keys. Now we can see whether
the president was democratic or republican, the closing values of the
S&P, and the unemployment % of each given year/month (if there is data
for that year/month). The years ranged from 1947 to 2015.

# Problem 2

### Importing & cleaning mr. trash wheel data set:

``` r
mr_trash_wheels_df = (
    # skips first row with figure/drawing
  read_excel("datasets/trash_wheel_collection.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |>  
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    # removes empty columns and columns not containing trash wheels specific data
    select(-x15, -x16, -homes_powered) |>  
    mutate(
      # converts to an int type & rounds to nearest int
      sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)), 
      wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
      year = as.integer(year)
     
    )
)
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

### Importing and cleaning prof trash wheel data set:

``` r
prof_trash_wheels_df = (
  read_excel("datasets/trash_wheel_collection.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |>  
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
    select(-homes_powered) |> 
    mutate( 
      wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel",
      year = as.integer(year)
      )
)
```

### Importing and cleaning Gwyns trash wheel data set:

``` r
gwyn_trash_wheel_df = (
  read_excel("datasets/trash_wheel_collection.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynns Falls Trash Wheel", skip = 1) |> 
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    select(-homes_powered) |> 
    mutate(
      wheel = "Gwynns Trash Wheel",
      year = as.integer(year)
      )
)
```

### Combining all data sets:

``` r
merged_trash_wheels_df = (
  bind_rows(
    mr_trash_wheels_df, 
    prof_trash_wheels_df, 
    gwyn_trash_wheel_df)
)
```

### Description of merged data set:

The three data sets were combined by using the ‘bind_rows’ function
because the data sets have overlapping columns and represent the same
type of observations. I made the decision to stack them vertically, with
the addition of the “wheel” column, indicating which trash wheel it came
from. In the resulting data set, there are 1191 total observations. By
wheel type, mr. trash wheel has 708 observations, professor trash wheel
has 133 observations, and gwynnda has 350 observations. The data set
contains the variable ‘weight_tons’ and ‘volume_cubic_yards,’ indicating
the total amount of litter in tons and the volume of litter in cubic
yards, respectively. The next columns show various litter types. The
total weight of trash collected by professor trash wheel is 564.52 tons.
The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
is 2142.94.

# Problem 3

### Importing and cleaning zip_codes data set:

``` r
zip_codes_df = (
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip Codes.csv") |> 
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    mutate(
      file_date = as.Date(file_date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
    )
)
```

    ## Rows: 322 Columns: 7
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (4): County, County Code, File Date, Neighborhood
    ## dbl (3): State FIPS, County FIPS, ZipCode
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Importing and cleaning zori data set:

``` r
zori_df = (
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(
    # take out 'name' in 'county_name' var
    county = county_name, 
    zip_code = region_name) |> 
  select(-region_type) |> 
  mutate(
    # remove the word 'county' in rows
    county = str_remove(county, "County")
  ) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(region_id:county),
    names_to = "file_date",
    values_to= "rental_price"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    file_date = str_remove(file_date, "^x"),
    file_date = str_replace_all(file_date, "_", "-"), 
    file_date = as.Date(file_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
  )
)
```

    ## Rows: 149 Columns: 125
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr   (6): RegionType, StateName, State, City, Metro, CountyName
    ## dbl (119): RegionID, SizeRank, RegionName, 2015-01-31, 2015-02-28, 2015-03-3...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Merging the two zillow data sets:

``` r
merged_zillow_df = (
  full_join(zori_df, zip_codes_df, 
            by = c("zip_code", "county")) |> 
  # to keep only the zillow rental date (time-series)
  rename(file_date = file_date.x) |> 
  # drop the metadata date
  select(-file_date.y) |> 
  select(
        1:3, 
        file_date,
        state_fips:neighborhood, 
        everything())
)
```

I have created a merged data set using the ‘full_join’ function so that
no information from either data set is lost. It joins the data based on
the columns ‘zip_code,’ ‘county’, and ‘file_date,’ meaning that if there
is matching data in these three columns, they will be returned in the
same row. If the data does not match in either data set, it will keep
the row but return NA for the missing information. The total
observations in the merged data set are 17606. There are 320 unique ZIP
codes and 43 unique neighborhoods.

### Finding missing zipcodes:

``` r
missing_zips = (
  anti_join(
    zip_codes_df, zori_df,
    by = "zip_code"))
 
# count how many are missing
n_missing = nrow(missing_zips)

# view the first few rows
head(missing_zips, 5) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 7
    ##   county state_fips county_code county_fips zip_code file_date  neighborhood    
    ##   <chr>       <dbl> <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl> <date>     <chr>           
    ## 1 Bronx          36 005               36005    10464 2007-07-25 Southeast Bronx 
    ## 2 Bronx          36 005               36005    10474 2007-07-25 Hunts Point and…
    ## 3 Bronx          36 005               36005    10475 2007-07-25 Northeast Bronx 
    ## 4 Bronx          36 005               36005    10499 2007-07-25 <NA>            
    ## 5 Bronx          36 005               36005    10550 2007-07-25 <NA>

There are 171 rows that appear in the zip code data set but not in the
zillow rental price data set. From looking at the first five missing zip
codes, these zip codes may have very small rental listings during the
time period, be a owner-heavy neighborhood, or be industrial areas. For
example, 10474, in Hunts Point and Mott Haven, features a significant
industrial or mixed-use presence.

### Comparing rental prices from Jan 2021 to prices in Jan 2020

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 6
    ##    zip_code county      neighborhood rent_2020 rent_2021 rent_drop
    ##       <dbl> <chr>       <chr>            <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ##  1    10007 "New York " Unknown          6334.     5422.      913.
    ##  2    10069 "New York " Unknown          4623.     3875.      748.
    ##  3    10009 "New York " Unknown          3406.     2692.      714.
    ##  4    10016 "New York " Unknown          3731.     3019.      712.
    ##  5    10001 "New York " Unknown          4108.     3398.      710.
    ##  6    10002 "New York " Unknown          3645.     2935.      710.
    ##  7    10004 "New York " Unknown          3150.     2444.      706.
    ##  8    10038 "New York " Unknown          3573.     2876.      698.
    ##  9    10012 "New York " Unknown          3629.     2942.      686.
    ## 10    10010 "New York " Unknown          3697.     3012.      685.

This is a table I created showing the top 10 zip codes withe the largest
drop in price from January 2020 to January 2021. All 10 of these zip
codes are in Manhattan, which is typically the borough with the highest
rental prices, so when there are even moderate percentage drops in the
rental prices, the value the price decreases by is still large. The
highest drop is \$913 in zip code 1007, which was likely influenced by
the COVID-19 pandemic.
